# 🔍 OCR-API: Documentation

## 🧰 Technology Stack

### 💻 What Powers Our System

- **Python**: A user-friendly programming language that helps our system process information quickly and efficiently - think of it as the brain of our operation.

### 🧩 Main Building Blocks

- **🔤 Text Recognition Technology**: Our system can "read" text from images and documents, similar to how humans read but done by a computer.
- **📑 Specialized Document Processors**: We have different tools designed to handle specific types of documents:
  - 📝 Resume Processor: Understands and extracts information from job applications
  - 👶 Birth Certificate Processor: Pulls important details from birth records
  - 🪪 ID Document Processor: Works with driver's licenses, passports, and other identification
  - 🎓 Academic Certificate Processor: Handles diplomas and educational records
  - 👷‍♂️ Work Permit Processor: Manages employment authorization documents

### 🔄 Connected Systems

- **☁️ Google Drive Connection**: After we process your documents, we store them securely in Google Drive - similar to saving files in a digital filing cabinet.
- **📊 Airtable Connection**: We organize all the extracted information in Airtable - think of this as a smart spreadsheet that keeps everything organized.

## ⚙️ How Document Processing Works

Think of our document system as an intelligent sorting office that knows exactly what to do with each document it receives.

### 📋 Document Journey Step-by-Step

1. **📬 Document Arrives**: You send us a document through our system.

2. **🔍 Document Detective**: Our system first checks if there's actually a file attached. Just like checking if an envelope has something inside!

3. **🧐 Document Identification**: The system figures out what kind of document it is:

   - Is it a resume?
   - A birth certificate?
   - An ID card?
   - A diploma?
   - A work permit?

4. **👨‍💼 Expert Assignment**: Based on what the document is, we assign it to the right specialist:

   - Resumes go to our Resume Expert
   - Birth certificates go to our Certificate Expert
   - And so on...

   This is like having different specialists for different types of paperwork.

5. **📝 Information Extraction**: The specialist carefully reads the document and pulls out the important information - names, dates, ID numbers, qualifications, etc.

6. **🗄️ Secure Storage**: A copy of the document and its extracted information is safely stored in Google Drive.

7. **📊 Organized Records**: Finally, all the important details are placed into our Airtable system, neatly organized and ready for use.

### 🗺️ Behind the Scenes: How We Know What to Do With Each Document

Our system uses special "maps" (like treasure maps!) that tell it exactly what to do with each document:

- One map tells us which document confirmation needs which document type
- Another map tells us which document needs which expert processor
- These maps help our system work automatically without human guidance

### 🔄 The Path Documents Follow

```
Document → Check if Complete → Identify Type → Assign Expert →
Extract Information → Store Securely → Update Records
```

## 🔄 Background Service

Our system includes a helpful automated assistant that works behind the scenes:

### ⏱️ Automatic Document Processing

- **🤖 Always Working**: Our background service runs continuously, checking for new documents every 60 seconds - like having an assistant who never sleeps!

- **🔍 What It Does**: This service automatically:
  1. Checks Airtable for new document submissions
  2. Downloads any new files it finds
  3. Determines what type of documents they are
  4. Processes them using the appropriate specialist
  5. Uploads the results back to Google Drive
  6. Updates Airtable with the extracted information
- **⚡ Benefits**: This automation means:
  - No manual triggering needed
  - Documents are processed promptly
  - Information flows smoothly into your systems
  - Everything stays up-to-date without human intervention

The background service ensures that your document processing pipeline runs efficiently and continuously, providing a seamless experience for all users of the system. 🚀
